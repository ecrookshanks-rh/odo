title: odo remove binding
---

:::warning

As of February 2024, the [Service Binding Operator](https://github.com/redhat-developer/service-binding-operator/), which this command relies on, has been deprecated. See [Deprecation Notice](https://redhat-developer.github.io/service-binding-operator/userguide/intro.html).
`odo remove binding` may therefore not work as expected.

:::

## Description
The `odo remove binding` command removes the link created between the component and a service via Service Binding.

## Running the Command
Running this command removes the reference from the devfile, but does not necessarily remove it from the cluster. To remove the ServiceBinding from the cluster, you must run `odo dev`, or `odo deploy`.

The command takes a required `--name` flag that points to the name of the Service Binding to be removed.
```shell
odo remove binding --name <ServiceBinding_name>
```

<summary>Example</summary>

```shell
$ odo remove binding --name redis-service-my-nodejs-app
 âœ“  Successfully removed the binding from the devfile. You can now run `odo dev` or `odo deploy` to delete it from the cluster.
